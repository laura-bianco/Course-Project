# Course-Project
Hello! This is the introductory document that explains all the scripts in this repository and how they work together. 
This is my repository for the course project on getting and cleaning data. 

# Scripts
The run_analysis.R script is the code that executes all the requested transformation and cleaning of the data.
The CodeBook.md file describes the transformations performed in the R script, as well as the data and the variables used in the data.


If you are confused with how the run_analysis.R script works, then the CodeBook.md file will help explain what was done to the data to achieve the tidy_data.
The run_analysis.R script is split up into 5 different sections (one for each task) and each section is labelled so that it is clear what is being done in each step.
All the files required for the script to run are available on the course website under the course project assignment.
The data was collected from fitness tracker data and the link to the orinigal data is also available on the course website page.
